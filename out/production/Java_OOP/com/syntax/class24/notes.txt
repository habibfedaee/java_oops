>> Method overriding:
Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in parent class and in child classes.

>> Benefits:
 - Flexibility if we do not like something from the parent class we can override it and can provide
 our own implementation.
 - Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it.

>> Rules:
 1, without inheritance method overriding is not possible.
 2, method signature should be same in parent class and in child class.
 3, if something does not participate in inheritance we can't override it.
 4, we can increase the visibility in the child class, but we can't decrease it. for example, we can go
 from default or protected to public, but we cannot do the reverse.
 5, we cannot override a static method, but we can redeclare it. for example main method cannot
 be overridden because it is static.
 6, we cannot have different return type in the child class it must be the same as the parent class

>> OOPS Main Pillars:
 1, Inheritance (code re-usability)
 2, Polymorphism (less & dynamic code)
 3, Abstraction ()
 4, Encapsulation
