RECAP of class 18
>> Access Modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members (fields, methods, constructors, etc.)
and classes itself in java.

>> There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords for them that we use to define these access
level. Fourth level is applied when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
>> Most restricted to less restricted:
 1, Private (The code is only accessible within the declared class)
 2, Default (The code is only accessible in the same package. no keyword means default access level)
 3, Protected (The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses.)
 4, Public (accessible within the same project everywhere)

>> Rules:
 1, We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data
 and the methods of your class might that data to perform certain task. so, certain data with the
 certain code should be secure and working forever. If we don't perform sanity checks(*) before setting
 the values to these fields our classes and methods might misbehave also the access of the data should
 be restricted so that not every one can access the data.
 (*) A sanity check or sanity test is a basic test to quickly evaluate whether a claim or the result
 of a calculation can possibly be true. It is a simple check to see if the produced material is
 rational (that the material's creator was thinking rationally, applying sanity).

 2, We can't use access modifiers with local variables.

>> Constructors:
 Constructors in java allow us to set the values of the fields of a class.

 Constructors can be declared multiple times but with different or just one empty parameter list
