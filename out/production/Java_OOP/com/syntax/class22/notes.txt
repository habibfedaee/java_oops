=====================================================================================================
Inheritance in Java:
It is a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class.

Benefits:
 1, Saves time to code
 2, Less code duplication in the project
 3, execution time is faster

Disadvantages:
 >> Classes are tightly coupled (if we change something in parent class, it will affect the child class)

Types of inheritance: (4), in java 3
 1, Single type inheritance
 2, Hierarchical inheritance
 3, Multi-level inheritance
 4, Multiple inheritance --> not support in java
Single inheritance:
 In single inheritance we have only one child and one parent class. or only two classes participate
 in inheritance one as child and one as parent.
Example------
public class A{
 // codes in parent class
}

public class B extends A{
  // codes in child class
}--------------

Hierarchical inheritance:
  In hierarchical inheritance we have a single parent class and multiple child classes.
Example ----------
class Parent {
 // codes
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
 // codes
}
class Child2 extends Parent{
 // codes
}
class Child3 extends Parent{
 // codes
} ----------------

Multi-level inheritance:
  We have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A, B, and C. Class C will be
  inherited from B and B will be inherited from A.
Example ----------
Class A {
}
Class B extends A{
}
Class C extends B{
}------------------
--------------------------------------------------
>> Super Keyword:
Super keyword is like the 'this' keyword. It refers to the parent class object. For example, we can
access fields, methods or constructors of parent class inside the child class using the 'super'
keyword.

>> Method Overriding and Method Overloading:
Method overloading is a way to create similar named methods with different (parameters), different
sequence of parameters, or different data types of parameters inside a class.
