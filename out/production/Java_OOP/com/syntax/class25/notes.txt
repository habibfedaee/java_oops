>> Abstract classes in Java:
Abstract classes in java are the classes with abstract keyword to achieve abstraction. Abstraction is
the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to end user.

>> Benefits:
 1, Reduces the complexity
 2, Improves the maintainability
 3, Can also enforce rules up to a certain limit.

>> Disadvantages:
 1,


========Example
Class Dog{
    String name;
    static int legs=4;
    //concret class
}

public abstract class Phone{
    String make;
    String model;
    static boolean has5G=true;
}
============

>> Rules:
Abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do, but we cannot create their objects
directly and if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must either provide the implementation
for the abstract method or it must be declared abstract.
 1, we cannot have final and abstract keywords with a method at the same time.
 2, we cannot have static and abstract keywords with a method at the same time.
 3, abstract keyword with fields are not allowed.
