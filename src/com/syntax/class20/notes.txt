RECAP:

Constructors in Java:
 >> Constructors in java are special block of code similar to a method that initialize the
 objects of a class.

Rules:
 1, They don't have return types not even void
 2, Name of the constructor must be the same as name of the class
 3, Constructor can't have non access modifiers like static final etc.
 4, we can use the access modifiers like public private, protected with constructors
 5, if we do not write a constructor in a class a default constructor will be provided by compiler
 6, we can have multiple constructor in a class but their number of arguments sequence of argument or
    type of arguments should be different.
 7, If we have multiple constructors then Java will decide which constructor to call based on
    the parameters we pass.

THIS KEYWORD:
It is a reserved keyword in java that we can use to refer to instance variables, methods or
constructors of a class.
 1, 'This' keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
 2, we can use 'this' keyword to call the constructor of a class inside another constructors
 3, we can use the 'this' keyword to call the methods of a class.

INHERITANCE:
Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. In Java,
classes may inherit or acquire the properties and methods of other classes. A class derived
from another class is called a subclass, whereas the class from which a subclass is derived
is called a superclass.

The idea behind inheritance in java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
when we inherit from an existing class, we can reuse methods and fields of parent class, and
we can add new methods and fields also.

'extends' is the keyword that is used to inherit from an upper or parent class.
