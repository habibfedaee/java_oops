RECAP:
>> Abstract in Java:
 - means hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality to end-user

>> Two Method to achieve abstraction in java:
 1, Abstract classes
 2, Interfaces

>> Abstract classes:
Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword

>> Interfaces:
Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword.

>> How to decide which one to use:
 1, Prefer the interfaces over abstract classes
 2, if two or more classes are closely related to each other go with abstract classes for example:
 if we have to create a 'Lion' class and a 'Horse' class, we should go with abstract classes and
 should create an animal abstract class. If two classes are not related to each other for example
 an Apple and a Cloth, we should create an interface for that like if we want to have a behavior
 washAble().

>> Encapsulation:
It is the fourth pillar of OOPS. It provides security and better control over the data of a class.
We create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods. These methods are
called getters and setters methods. We can set and get values of the class fields with the help of
these methods instead of accessing and modifying them directly.
