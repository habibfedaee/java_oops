>> Method overloading in Java:
When same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters or different data type
of parameters or different sequence of parameters.

>> Advantages of method overloading:
 - Flexibility of having same name methods in a class
 - end user gets the benefits that he/she does not need to remember different method names.

>> Rules:
 - we can overload the constructors
 - we can overload the static methods as well
 - we can overload the main method as well, but with different parameters

>> Method overriding:
 1, overriding happens when we have same named methods in the parent and in the child class
 2, we can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two classes
 3, we cannot override the private methods and attributes of the parent class
 4, we cannot override the constructors because they do not participate in inheritance
