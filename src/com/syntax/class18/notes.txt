Recap of class 17
Types of variable: 3: local, instance, static

local variable: is declared inside a method or block of code
    Pros:   takes less memory
    Cons:   limited access & shorter life-time

instance variable: is declared inside the body of a class.
    Pros:   accessible everywhere,
    Cons:   takes lots of memory,

static variable: is declared inside the body of a class or inside a static method
    Pros:   is declared once used everywhere, also take single memory location for all the objects of that class.
    Cons:   can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory than instance variables

Class 18
Java Access Modifiers
(public, private, protected, default)
Access modifiers are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable, method, class
constructor etc. can be accessed.
There are four types of access in java that we can define using 3 keywords.

1, Private access modifier
 when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes these can only be
 accessed within that class.

2, Default access modifier
 it is applied when we don't use any other access modifiers to variables, methods, or classes.
 These variables, methods, or classes can be accessed by other classes or methods within the same
 package.

3, Protected access modifier
 when Protected access modifier keyword is applied, class members(variables, methods, etc.) can
 be accessed from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance.

4, Public access modifier
  public access means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.

---------Note!
static methods can access other static methods and fields without needing an object of that
class or the class name if they are inside the same class.
