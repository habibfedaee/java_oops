>> Maps in Java:
   Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in the key value pairs.

   Benefits:
   1, we can store two values inside the maps
   2, searching is very efficient in maps

   Types of Maps:
   1, HashMap
   2, LinkedHashMap
   3, TreeMap

   HashMap:
   1, insertion order is not mainted (downside)
   2, insertion and retrieval is fastest (upside)

   LinkedHashMap:
   1, insertion order is maintained (upside)
   2, insertion speed is same as HashMap but retrieval speed is slowest in all the maps

   TreeMap:
   1, Data is sorted in natural order by default.
   2, insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than linkedHashMap but slower than HashMap.

   Rules:
   - we cannot convert collection (lists or sets) types to Maps.
   e.g.
   Map<int, String> students = new Map<>();
   students.put(1122, "habib");
   students.put(2233, "jawed");
   // if we try to convert there are two columns in maps that cannot fit in sets or lists
   - duplicate values in key column not accepted in maps
   - duplicate values in value column accepted
   - duplicate values will be overridden
   - auto-casting does not work in maps
