>> Set in Java:
   set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes. for example,
   HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeHashSet.

   Properties of Set:
   - All the sets do not allow duplicates.
   - cannot maintain insertion order

   HashSet:
    - HashSet does not maintain the insertion order.
    - no duplicate values allowed
    - it is the fastest in all Sets
    - mostly and widely used Set.

   LinkedHashSet:
    - maintains the insertion order
    - slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet, specially the insertion

   TreeSet:
    - Sorts the data in natural order. for number in increasing order.
    - it is slowest when it comes to storing the data.

   When to use which type of Set:
    - if we do not care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet.
    - if we need the insertion order we(batch 12) don't have much choice.
      we have to use the linkedHashSet, but if we do not care about the insertion order, we can
      compare it with TreeSet

      LinkedHashSet              vs             TreeHashSet
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Insertion not slow                        slowest in insertion time
      retrieval super slow                      slower than HashSet but faster than linkedHashSet

      Question 1:
      I don't care about insertion order but, I care about retrieval speed, which Set should I use?
      Answer: HashSet

      Question 2:
      I care about insertion order but, I don't care about retrieval speed which Set should I
      use?
      Answer: LinkedHashSet

      Question 3:
      What to use if I want to have sorted data all the time?
      Answer: TreeSet
