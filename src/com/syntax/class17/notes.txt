Types of variables

in java there are 3 types of variables
 1. local (inside method or block)
 2. static (with keyword static)
 3. instance (inside class)

when the information is expected to be different from object to object, we store that
information in instance variables

if we know that a value will stay the same for all the objects of a class, we create a
static variable for information
